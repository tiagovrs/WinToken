## üìã What is WinToken?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WinToken is the solution for engaging fans on sports streaming. First conceived for NBA enthusiasts, WinToken is a betting web app integrated with Blockchain technology. It incentivizes the basketball community to actively participate in the game, while ensuring the security and transparency inherent to decentralized applications. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such purpose, WinToken shall be present in live streamings of NBA games featuring famous teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics. It is expected that in its first appeareances, the fans may be puzzled with the sudden pop-up: "Reedem 200 tokens today and enter for a chance to win NFT" followed by a QR code on their Twitch screens. However, soon natural curiosity will follow. That is when our user journey begins. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our app is about costumer loyalty and taking sports to costumers' home. It is not enough betting and seeing the result of your bet afterwards when the game is over. We want people to bet and constantly interact with the game. For those people who are engaged stadium-goers, we give the opportunity to thrilled and pennyless watch their teams and bet on it. On the other hands, for those people who don't watch any games at all, but like to bet, we give a reason to engage in their favorite sport. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to perform such tasks, WinToken's user shall have the following journey:
- Reedem x tokens by scanning a QR Code that randomly pops up on Twitch sports' transmissions
- Exchange tokens for exciting bets:
> how many points will Lebron make today? Enter a number: _____"
- If right, earn an exclusive NFT. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it can be seen that our app adds a completely new dimension for betting prizes today. It revolutizes the market for betting by giving sports fans the chance to enter the NFT market. Our value proposal to overcome the competition is explore a new market: NFTbets. This is what WinToken is about. 

## Market Analysis

## Persona & User Stories
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personas and User stories are essential pieces of the development of a MVP. Both have direct impact into how the solution will be built, working as a tool to guide the developers and the designers into the user-focused development. <b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personas, especifically, have the power to create empathy into the development team, as they have a user to focus and to attend. <b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the user stories work as a key to the agile development. They are used to help the definition of the development scope, helping the devs to focus on the essential functionalities of the application. <b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, both personas and user stories are crucial to the identification, definition and priorization of the requirements of the MVP. They work to guarantee the viability of the work and remind the team to create a solution that is user centered. That is why the WinToken have the "Fanatic", Joshua as its persona: to remind the team to create a solution that brings value to the final user.

### Value Proposition Canva
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Value Proposition Canva (VPC) is a visual tool that describe and analyse the value a solution give to the user. It aims to understand the way a solution relives the pain of the final client, while creating gains and making their job to finish a task easier. This tool is pivotal to the development of any solution, particularly into the software development, as it helps the designers and developers to create a user-focused application.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the image above, it is clear that our solution focus on solving the "boring streaming" problem, making it more engageful to the viewer to watch a four hours match. Offering a NFT and non-monetary-bidding as the principal products. The aim of WinToken is to engage the user with the idea of obtaining a prize, such as a NFT, just for watching a basketball, soccer or any sport streaming and bidding with digital coins without cost.

## üíª Configura√ß√£o para desenvolvimento e execu√ß√£o do c√≥digo

*Acrescentar as informa√ß√µes necess√°rias sobre pr√©-requisitos (IDEs, bibliotecas, servi√ßos etc.) e instala√ß√£o b√°sica do projeto, descrevendo eventuais vers√µes utilizadas. Colocar um passo a passo de como o leitor pode baixar o c√≥digo e executar a aplica√ß√£o a partir de sua m√°quina local.*

*exemplo de instru√ß√µes*

Aqui encontram-se todas as instru√ß√µes necess√°rias para a instala√ß√£o de todos os programas, bibliotecas e ferramentas imprescind√≠veis para a configura√ß√£o do ambiente de desenvolvimento.

1. Baixar e instalar o node.js: [https://nodejs.org/pt-br/](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/) (vers√£o 16.15.1 LTS)
2. Clone o reposit√≥rio em quest√£o.
3. No modo administrador, abra o "prompt de comando" ou o "terminal" e, ap√≥s, abra a pasta "src/backend" no diret√≥rio raiz do reposit√≥rio clonado e digite o segundo comando:
