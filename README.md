###  2.1 What is WinToken?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WinToken is the solution for engaging fans on sports streaming. First conceived for NBA enthusiasts, WinToken is a betting web app integrated with Blockchain technology. It incentivizes the basketball community to actively participate in the game, while ensuring the security and transparency inherent to decentralized applications. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For such purpose, WinToken shall be present in live streamings of NBA games featuring famous teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics. It is expected that in its first appeareances, the fans may be puzzled with the sudden pop-up: "Redeem 200 tokens today and enter for a chance to win NFT" followed by a QR code on their Twitch screens. However, soon natural curiosity will follow. That is when our user journey begins. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our app is about costumer loyalty and taking sports to costumers' home. It is not enough betting and seeing the result of your bet afterwards when the game is over. We want people to bet and constantly interact with the game. For those people who are engaged stadium-goers, we give the opportunity to thrilled and pennyless watch their teams and bet on it. On the other hands, for those people who don't watch any games at all, but like to bet, we give a reason to engage in their favorite sport. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to perform such tasks, WinToken's user shall have the following journey:
- Reedem x tokens by scanning a QR Code that randomly pops up on Twitch sports' transmissions
- Exchange tokens for exciting bets:
> "How many points will Lebron make today? 
> Enter a number: _____"
- If right, earn an exclusive NFT. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it can be seen that our app adds a completely new dimension for betting prizes today. It revolutizes the market for betting by giving sports fans the chance to enter the NFT market. Our value proposal to overcome the competition is explore a new market: NFTbets. This is what WinToken is about. 

###  2.2 Why WinToken?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WinToken starts its journey in streaming services. This is justified by the recent surge of sports online streaming services. Currently, TV audiences for sports are falling and shares from companies such as Warner Bros - one of NBA's broadcast partners - face all time lows (BLOOMBERG NEWS; GLUM, 2024). Meanwhile, ESPN and Disney are launching a joint for a sports streaming service, which is expected to promote NBA with more accessibility (DEITSCH et al., 2024). Hence, it is clear that products that use streamings as their main propaganda platform are taking great advantage of current opportunities <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the other end - the prizes in NFT -, it concerns innovation. Fans of yesterday used player cards to showcase their enthusiasm for an specific sport. Fans of today use NFTs and the benefits of blockchain to engage with their favorites teams. It's nearly impossible to steal an NFT, ensuring players feel secure with the game. Furthermore, blockchain makes the app transparent and readily trustable, which is a great benefit when it comes to betting apps. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, we excluded the financial aspect of collectible stickers. With WinToken, one can simply watch the game, guess correctly a stats from the game and they win an exclusive prize. The experience becomes more interconnected and it resembles an sports game rather than luck. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the central aspect of WinToken - gamified betting -, it is justified given the context in which the webapp will be launch. It references a common practice of our user: the sports fan. Moreover, it re-creates the process by adding virtous cycle: watch a match, reedem tokens, bet, watch a match; that does not generate financial loss to our user. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above reasons combined generate the need for WinToken today. WinToken benefits are summarised into four bullet points:
- Enhanced user engagement through gamified betting and NFT prizes.
- Increased security and transparency with blockchain technology.
- Elimination of financial risk associated with traditional sports betting.
- Integration with streaming services provides convenient access to live sports events.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the mix of betting, streaming, and blockchain that makes our app unique and innovative. However, we understand that the best software can only be developed when it is user-centered and the result of a thorough market analysis. Hence, this section is followed by our market analysis

##  <a name="c3"></a>üåê 3. Market Analysis

### 3.1 SWOT Analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) Analysis is a tool that can be used to holistically analyze a project. Now a SWOT analysis of the WinToken application into the entertainment market in USA.

### Strengths:
1. <b>Blockchain for security</b> and transparency, leading with the fear of betting into a non-secure platform.
2. <b>NFT for entertainment</b> as it is already used by the Chilliz, adding more accessibility and engagefulness.

### Weaknesses:
1. <b>High dependecy of famous sport leagues</b> to promote the NFTs.

### Opportunities:
1. <b>Fast increasing market: </b>as the sportive bet is an opportunity to receive investment and notoriety to the solution.
2. <b>Volatile solution: </b>such as the WinToken that can adapt itself to different types of sports, bets and streamings.

### Threats:
1. <b>Gambling stigma</b> that is common to the public, such as gambling being a sin.
2. <b>High cost</b> to operate into famous scenarios, such as the NBA.

## 3.2 Persona & User Stories
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personas and User stories are essential pieces of the development of a MVP. Both have direct impact into how the solution will be built, working as a tool to guide the developers and the designers into the user-focused development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personas, specifically, have the power to create empathy into the development team, as they have a user to focus and to attend.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the user stories work as a key to the agile development. They are used to help the definition of the development scope, helping the devs to focus on the essential functionalities of the application.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, both personas and user stories are crucial to the identification, definition and priorization of the requirements of the MVP. They work to guarantee the viability of the work and remind the team to create a solution that is user centered. That is why the WinToken have the "Fanatic", Joshua as its persona: to remind the team to create a solution that brings value to the final user.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Joshua, the team of development was capable to measure how their features, such as the QR Code scanning section, were affecting his experience inside the app. With his stories, they were able to focus in creating features, such as the highlights, that were useful and meaningful to the application.

### 3.3 Value Proposition Canva

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Value Proposition Canva (VPC) is a visual tool that describe and analyse the value a solution give to the user. It aims to understand the way a solution relives the pain of the final client, while creating gains and making their job to finish a task easier. This tool is pivotal to the development of any solution, particularly into the software development, as it helps the designers and developers to create a user-focused application.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the image above, it is clear that our solution focus on solving the "boring streaming" problem, making it more engageful to the viewer to watch a four hours match. Offering a NFT and non-monetary-bidding as the principal products. The aim of WinToken is to engage the user with the idea of obtaining a prize, such as a NFT, just for watching a basketball, soccer or any sport streaming and bidding with digital coins without cost.
